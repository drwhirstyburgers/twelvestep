  <p class="lead">Having a rough day? On the verge of a relapse? Sometimes we just need
    someone who we can talk to and, more importantly, relate to. 12Step is an anonymous chat
    app for people in recovery that seeks to fulfill that need. All chats are private, anonymous,
    and self-destruct after 24 hours.
